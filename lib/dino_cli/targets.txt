              Atmega4809 (unconfirmed)

              Mega 1280, Mega 2560, Mega ADK
              Nano Every, Uno WiFi Rev2 (unconfirmed)


    esp32

      For the the ESP32 chip by Espressif, with integrated 2.4Ghz WiFi.
      No WiFi OTA updates yet.
      This option includes all component features EXCEPT:
          Serial, LCD

      Chips:  ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3
      Boards: ESP32 DevKit, LOLIN D32 / D32 Pro, LOLIN S2 Pico / Mini,
              LOLIN S3 Pico / Mini
         

    esp8266

      For the ESP8266 chip by Espressif, with integrated 2.4Ghz WiFi.
      WiFi over-the-air updates are enabled by default.
      This option includes all component features EXCEPT:
          Serial, LCD

      Chips:  ES8266, ESP8285
      Boards: WeMos D1, Node MCU, Bare Modules

      Note: Building the (default) serial sketch will only allow connections via
            serial. Build the WiFi sketch to connect via the integrated WiFi.

      Note: After the initial upload via serial, the WiFi sketch for this target
            supports over-the-air updates from the Arduino IDE using ArduinoOTA.
            
            
   rp2040

     For the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller.
     Software Serial doesn't work. WiFi available only on the W version.
     This option includes all component features EXCEPT:
         Serial

     Chips:  RP2040
     Boards: Raspberry Pi Pico, Raspberry Pi Pico W, and many others
     

   samd

     For the ATSAMD21G18, with native USB and no EEPROM.
     Similar to the mega option, but Software Serial doesn't work.
     This option includes all component features EXCEPT:
         EEPROM, Serial

     Chips:  ATSAMD21G18
     Boards: Arduino Zero, M0, M0 Pro


    sam3x

      Fpr the ATSAM3X8E, with native USB and no EEPROM.
      Similar to the mega option, but some features don't work.
      This option includes all component features EXCEPT:
          EEPROM, Serial, Tone, IR Out

      Chips:  ATSAM3X8E
      Boards: Arduino Due
      
      
    core

      This includes only the core component feature set of dino:
        Set Pin Mode
        Digital Read/Write/Listen
        Analog Read/Write/Listen

      This is mostly useful for testing, or if severely limited on memory, as it
      is the smallest sketch possible, and should be universally compatible.


    mega168

      This targets the older ATmega168 chip used in early Arduinos.
      With half the RAM and flash available, we need to cut the sketch down.
      This option includes core functionality AND:
          Servo (6 maxmium), DHT, Shift In/Out, Tone, SPI, I2C

      Chips:  ATmega168
      Boards: Duemilanove, Diecimila, Pro (some), Pro Mini (some)
              (Later versions of these may carry an ATmega328)

      Note: While you can generate this sketch using any connection type,
            only the serial version actually fits on the ATmega168.
            There is not enough memory available for Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
            Try the core target instead to tradeoff features for networking.

      Note: Aux message is always limited to 264 bytes or less for the ATmega168.
            Servo count is always limited to 6 (normally 12) for the ATmega168 chip.
            These limits apply as long as an Atmega168 is selected in the
            Arduino IDE, regardless of the options passed to this sketch generator.


  NOTE: You can manually control which features are enabled before compiling, by editing
  by editing DinoDefines.h. (Un)comment #define lines there to toggle features as needed.
