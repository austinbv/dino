### Install Arduino Dependencies for Dino (IDE)

### Installing Cores

Some microcontroller platforms require board manager cores that do not come with the IDE. To install a core:
  * Open the Preferences window of the IDE, and find "Additional boards manager URLS:". Click the button next to it.
  * In the editor that opens, paste the given URL on a new line at the end (if it doesn't already exist).
  * Confirm and exit Preferences. Wait for the IDE to finish downloading indexes from the new URL.
  * Click on Tools > Board > Board Manager.
  * Search for the platform you are installing by name, and click Install, optionally selecting a version.
   
### Installing Libraries

All platforms will require libraries to be installed. To install a library do the following:
  * Click on Tools > Manage Libraries.
  * Search for the library you are installing by name, and click Install, optionally selecting a version.
