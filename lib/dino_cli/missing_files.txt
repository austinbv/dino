  
  If all the missing files are from the vendor directory, you have 2 options:

  1) If you cloned the dino repo with git, please run:

     git submodule update --init --recursive

     Then try generating the sketch again.
     This command clones the needed repos into dino's src/vendor folder.

  2) If you installed the gem via gem install, you can ignore missing vendor
    files and install the libraries in your Arduino app instead.

     The libraries used are:
     
       IRremote v2.3.2
       IRremoteESP8266 v2.3.2

     In the Arduino app's library manager, search for them by name. Please
     install the versions listed here. Newer or older versions may be incompatible.
